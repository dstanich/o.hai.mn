If you're looking for the contents of this site, you probably are looking for the Github Pages branch.

To contribute, you should 

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork on your computer
3. Check out the gh-pages branch
4. Edit README.md with your changes (note that it contains different content than the README.md you're currently reading)
5. Install the marked cli tool with `npm install -g marked`
6. Run `marked -o index.html README.md` to convert README.md to html
7. Commit and push your changes to your fork
8. Put in a pull request

Eventually I'll have a better system for doing this, but in the mean time, this will work.

Thanks!
